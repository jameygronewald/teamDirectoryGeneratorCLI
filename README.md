  ## Description
  Team Directory Generator is a CLI that uses node.js and npm packages Inquirer and Jest to prompt a user with questions and take the user input as data to dynamically generate an HTML page containing info for the user's development team members. The app uses ES6 classes for the employee roles and each class is unit tested through the npm package Jest. The app uses Bootstrap and CSS for a fully responsive and engaging generated page.
